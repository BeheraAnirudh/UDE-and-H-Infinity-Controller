Modelling UDE &amp; H∞ Controller for Maglev Application
In this paper, an uncertainty and disturbance estimator (UDE)-based robust controller and H∞ controller is proposed to address disturbance and noise problems. In this study, the sufficient and necessary sterilizability conditions of the UDE-based robust control and H∞ controller are investigated. According to the sterilizability conditions, a systematically design method is presented for the reference model based on the controllable canonical transformation and pole placement. This is then applied to a magnetic levitation system (Maglev) subject to model uncertainties and external disturbance as an example. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach with respect to matched uncertainties.
